gtfs-mysql
==========

This repository is a MySQL database schema for the GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification). 
This builds on the SQl schema provided at https://github.com/mauryquijada/gtfs-mysql by adding support
for non-integer IDs. In particular, this applies to [Transport for NSW.](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/)
